In addition to arbitrary file uploads and limited file upload attacks, there are a few other techniques and attacks worth mentioning, as they may become handy in some web penetration tests or bug bounty tests. Let's discuss some of these techniques and when we may use them.
## Preventing File Upload Vulnerabilities
Throughout this module, we have discussed various methods of exploiting different file upload vulnerabilities. In any penetration test or bug bounty exercise we take part in, we must be able to report action points to be taken to rectify the identified vulnerabilities.

This section will discuss what we can do to ensure that our file upload functions are securely coded and safe against exploitation and what action points we can recommend for each type of file upload vulnerability.

## Extension Validation

The first and most common type of upload vulnerabilities we discussed in this module was file extension validation. File extensions play an important role in how files and scripts are executed, as most web servers and web applications tend to use file extensions to set their execution properties. This is why we should make sure that our file upload functions can securely handle extension validation.

While whitelisting extensions is always more secure, as we have seen previously, it is recommended to use both by whitelisting the allowed extensions and blacklisting dangerous extensions. This way, the blacklist list will prevent uploading malicious scripts if the whitelist is ever bypassed (e.g. shell.php.jpg).
